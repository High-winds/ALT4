    <p>The goal is to make an embedded system that has a focus on assisting a certain element of the community. The system has both basic an advanced requirements which we will be striving to fulfil in out device. The spacific embeded computern we are using is the BBC Micro:bit.<br><br>

        There are many existing systems and resources designed around a specific community challenge or need. The stakeholders would of course be the community and more specifically the part of the community we will be assisting. For example the Acorn tablet was made to assist disabled/elderly members of society in using devices. We have identified that there is a commercially available solution to a potential problem we are considering, 'Life Alert' <br><br>
        
        Embedded systems are not designed to be powerful or overly complicated, but the effects they can have when designed properly can be significant and that is why we find microbits so interesting. We  would like if our system helped those less able in our community. <br><br>
        
        Previously in our Leaving Certificate Computer Science course, we studied the Stevie robot. This is a complicated machine made to support the elderly people in our community, however, we beleve the simple idea could be applied to a Microbit. <br><br>
        
        Some of us have a large family, many of them being quite elderly, they are all very independent, but sometimes we wonder how people with grandparents/relatives who may be more susceptible to risk feel at times. Some of our grandparents have suffered from their increased risk <br><br>
        
        We like the idea of helping the elderly as they are growing percentage of the Irish community, with many needs that could be met by simple devices similar to Microbits.
