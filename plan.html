<h1>Plan stage</h1>
<p>
 What idea did you choose? Why did you choose it?. 
<br>[Perhaps use a table to state the advantages and disadvantages of each idea. Then expand more on why you chose the option you did.] 

<b><br>The idea We chose was to produce a fall monitor that uses one mircobit as a central controller, and use additional microbits as fall detectors</b>
</p>
 
<p>
Initial System Requirements: 

[include hardware and software. Mention backup location (MakeCode account)] 

<b><br>It will require at a minimum 2 microbits, but can comfortably accommodate 3 more microbits, a breakout and bread bord, one buzzer, a minimum of one orange and one red LED </b>
</p> 

Develop the idea further. 

[A description of what the system will do and/or not do.  

State clearly the System Objectives. 

 In lists include: a rough diagram of system architecture (visio/tinkerCad)] 


 

 

Target Audience: 

[Who will use it? Why? Refer back to problems identified to be solved] 

Our target audience is nursing homes and other communal care facilities, where there is a substantial fall risk for patents 

 

Accessibility: How will you implement Universal Design and UX? 

[Consider end user experience, consider how less-able people would experience the game.] 

The information will be easily accessible, using a buzzer to alert staff to a fall and separate orange and red LEDs indicating the severity of the fall 

 

 

Ethical/Social/Moral Considerations:  

[You may have to think here about developing your model at a larger scale to predict future implications.] 

I don't foresee any moral or ethical issues as the system would be non-evasive and designed to simply alert staff to a fall and leave it to their superior judgment, though it might lead to an environment of negligence as health care personnel might not look out for falls themselves. 

 

How will you know if you've succeeded? 

[State some success criteria here. Refer back to the requirements of the brief] 

We will know if we succeed by successfully detecting falls of different severity, and segregating the inputs into their respective outputs. 

 

Timescale: 

[Include a planning chart of some sort.] 

I believe that we can achieve a quick roll out making the system easily expandable
