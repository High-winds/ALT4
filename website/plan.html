    We chose to make a device that could detect when patients in a hospital are in danger or have fallen. We chose this idea as it met all the goals, we wished to accomplish such as using inter-device communication and helping the less able. <br>
    Here is some of our previous ideas and their advantages and disadvadvantages:
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Idea</th>
            <th>Advantages</th>
            <th>Disadvantages</th>
            <th>Accepted</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Gym Progress Tracker</td>
            <td>More people are entering the new year so there is an increse in market size.</td>
            <td>Not much possibility for meeting perscribed basic and advanced requirements. Did not receve unanamus intrest so further ideas were pursued.</td>
            <td>❌</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Elderly Memory Game</td>
            <td>It will help our target audence, which makes it more meaningful for us.</td>
            <td>The project would be overly complaceted. we cannot match its features with the perscribed requirments of the project.</td>
            <td>❌</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Patient Fall and Distress Detector</td>
            <td>It meets the both the basic and advanced requirments set out by the project brief. It also helps our target audence so holds a higher importance to us.</td>
            <td>It may be dificult to measure and quantify what consttutes a fall, and differenciate it from normal perambulation</td>
            <td>✅</td>

    The hardware required at the moment would simply be the micro:bit itself. We will also be using a breadboard to further control the input and outputs. We will be designing the software for the centeral micro:bit on the MakeCode account assigned to Jake, and the software for the detecting micro:bit on the Makecode account of Alex.
</p>
<p>
    The idea is for the system to detect any falls or accidents a patient has, broadcast that information to an external breakout board to be used as a central control. This data can then be broadcast too other micro:bits that will act as receivers to the incident. <br>
