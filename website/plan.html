<h1>Plan stage</h1>
<p>
 What idea did you choose? Why did you choose it?. 
<br>[Perhaps use a table to state the advantages and disadvantages of each idea. Then expand more on why you chose the option you did.] 

<b><br>The idea We chose was to produce a fall monitor that uses one mircobit as a central controller, and use additional microbits as fall detectors</b>
</p>
 
<p>
Initial System Requirements: 

<br>[include hardware and software. Mention backup location (MakeCode account)] 

<b><br>It will require at a minimum 2 microbits, but can comfortably accommodate 3 more microbits, a breakout and bread bord, one buzzer, a minimum of one orange and one red LED </b>
</p> 
<p>
Develop the idea further. 

<br>[A description of what the system will do and/or not do.  

State clearly the System Objectives. 

 <br>In lists include: a rough diagram of system architecture (visio/tinkerCad)] 

<br><img src="\ALT 4\images/More detailed Sketch of Fall monitor Alex C ALT 4.png" alt="A rough sketch of the system" style="height: 397px; width: 713px; border: #000000;border-width: 5px; border-style: solid;">
</p>

 
<p>
Target Audience: 

<br>[Who will use it? Why? Refer back to problems identified to be solved] 

<br> <b>Our target audience is nursing homes and other communal care facilities, where there is a substantial fall risk for patents </b>
</p>
 
<p>
Accessibility: How will you implement Universal Design and UX? 

<br>[Consider end user experience, consider how less-able people would experience the game.] 

<br><b>The information will be easily accessible, using a buzzer to alert staff to a fall and separate orange and red LEDs indicating the severity of the fall </b>

</p>

 
<p>
Ethical/Social/Moral Considerations:  

<br>[You may have to think here about developing your model at a larger scale to predict future implications.] 

<br><b>I don't foresee any moral or ethical issues as the system would be non-evasive and designed to simply alert staff to a fall and leave it to their superior judgment, though it might lead to an environment of negligence as health care personnel might not look out for falls themselves. </b>
</p>
 
<p>
How will you know if you've succeeded? 

<br>[State some success criteria here. Refer back to the requirements of the brief] 

<br><b> will know if we succeed by successfully detecting falls of different severity, and segregating the inputs into their respective outputs. </b>

 </p>
<p>
Timescale: 

<br>[Include a planning chart of some sort.] 

<br><b>I believe that we can achieve a quick roll out making the system easily expandable </b>
